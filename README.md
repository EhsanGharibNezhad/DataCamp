# DataCamp

- DataCamp offers interactive courses in the browser.
  - I've taken coursers from COURSERA, edX, UDACITY, Udemy and LinkedIn Learning, but I prefer the format implemented by DataCamp.
- As noted, the courses are interactive, in the browser, so I have taken the time to create Jupyter Notebooks for most of the courses I've taken.
  - I have implemented my notebooks in such a way as to be fully executable, though there may be some required backend setup (e.g. downloading data files or setting up a PostgreSQL database).
   - Links to data are in the notebook.
   - There are no hidden functions.
- An executed HTML version of my notebooks can be found [here][1].
