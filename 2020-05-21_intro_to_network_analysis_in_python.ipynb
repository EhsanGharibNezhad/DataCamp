    "From on-line social networks such as Facebook and Twitter to transportation networks such as bike sharing systems, networks are everywhere. And knowing how to analyze them will open up a new world of possibilities for you as a data scientist. This course will equip you with the skills to analyze, visualize, and make sense of networks. You'll apply the concepts you learn to real-world network data using the powerful `NetworkX` library. With the knowledge gained in this course, you'll develop your network thinking skills and be able to look at your data with a fresh perspective."

    "\n",

Specifically, you're going to look for \"nodes of interest\" and \"edges of interest\". To achieve this, you'll make use of the `.nodes()` and `.edges()` methods that Eric went over in the video. The `.nodes()` method returns a list of nodes, while the `.edges()` method returns a list of tuples, in which each tuple shows the nodes that are present on that edge. Recall that passing in the keyword argument data=True in these methods retrieves the corresponding metadata associated with the nodes and edges as well.\n",
