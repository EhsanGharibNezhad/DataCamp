    "From on-line social networks such as Facebook and Twitter to transportation networks such as bike sharing systems, networks are everywhere. And knowing how to analyze them will open up a new world of possibilities for you as a data scientist. This course will equip you with the skills to analyze, visualize, and make sense of networks. You'll apply the concepts you learn to real-world network data using the powerful `NetworkX` library. With the knowledge gained in this course, you'll develop your network thinking skills and be able to look at your data with a fresh perspective."

Specifically, you're going to look for \"nodes of interest\" and \"edges of interest\". To achieve this, you'll make use of the `.nodes()` and `.edges()` methods that Eric went over in the video. The `.nodes()` method returns a list of nodes, while the `.edges()` method returns a list of tuples, in which each tuple shows the nodes that are present on that edge. Recall that passing in the keyword argument data=True in these methods retrieves the corresponding metadata associated with the nodes and edges as well.\n",

    "\n",
    "`nxviz` is a package for visualizing graphs in a rational fashion. Under the hood, the `MatrixPlo`t utilizes `nx.to_numpy_matrix(G)`, which returns the matrix form of the graph. Here, each node is one column and one row, and an edge between the two nodes is indicated by the value 1. In doing so, however, only the `weight` metadata is preserved; all other metadata is lost, as you'll verify using an `assert` statement.\n",
    "\n",
    "A corresponding `nx.from_numpy_matrix(A)` allows one to quickly create a graph from a NumPy matrix. The default graph type is `Graph()`; if you want to make it a `DiGraph()`, that has to be specified using the `create_using` keyword argument, e.g. (`nx.from_numpy_matrix(A, create_using=nx.DiGraph`)).\n",
