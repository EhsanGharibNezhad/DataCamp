    "You’ve already used SQL to query data from databases. But did you know that there's a lot more you can do with databases? You can model different phenomena in your data, as well as the relationships between them. This gives your data structure and consistency, which results in better data quality. In this course, you'll experience this firsthand by working with a real-life dataset that was used to investigate questionable university affiliations. Column by column, table by table, you'll get to unlock and admire the full potential of databases. You'll learn how to create tables and specify their relationships, as well as how to enforce data integrity. You'll also discover other unique features of database systems, such as constraints."
