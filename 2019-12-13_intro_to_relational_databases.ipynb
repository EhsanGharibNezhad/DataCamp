    "You’ve already used SQL to query data from databases. But did you know that there's a lot more you can do with databases? You can model different phenomena in your data, as well as the relationships between them. This gives your data structure and consistency, which results in better data quality. In this course, you'll experience this firsthand by working with a real-life dataset that was used to investigate questionable university affiliations. Column by column, table by table, you'll get to unlock and admire the full potential of databases. You'll learn how to create tables and specify their relationships, as well as how to enforce data integrity. You'll also discover other unique features of database systems, such as constraints."

    "* To go further from here, it's useful to look at the bigger picture for a minute.\n",
    "* In this course, a database has been transformed.\n",
    " * That was done with PostgreSQL, which is also call a **Database Management System** or **DBMS**.\n",
    " * The **DBMS** and one or more databases together form the **Database System**.\n",
    " * The **DBMS** exposes a query interface where you can run ad-hoc analyses and queries with SQL.\n",
    " * You can also access this interface through other client applications.\n",
    " * You could, for example, program a Python script that connects to the database, loads data from it, and visualizes it.\n",
    "* In the remainder of this course, you'll no longer manipulate data in your database system, but employ some analysis queries on your database.\n",
    " * This will be a quick repetition of what you've learned in previous SQL courses such as **[Into to SQL for Data Science][4]**, but it will also demonstrate the advantages of having a database instead of a flat file in the first place.\n",
