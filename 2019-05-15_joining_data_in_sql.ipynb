    "Now that you've learned the basics of SQL in our [Intro to SQL for Data Science](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/intro-to-sql-for-data-science) course, it's time to supercharge your queries using joins and relational set theory! In this course you'll learn all about the power of joining tables while exploring interesting features of countries and their cities throughout the world. You will master inner and outer joins, as well as self-joins, semi-joins, anti-joins and cross joins - fundamental tools in any PostgreSQL wizard's toolbox. You'll fear set theory no more, after learning all about unions, intersections, and except clauses through easy-to-understand diagrams and examples. Lastly, you'll be introduced to the challenging topic of subqueries. You will see a visual perspective to grasp the ideas throughout the course using the mediums of Venn diagrams and other linking illustrations."
