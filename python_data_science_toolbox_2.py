# Using Iterators in Python

# Here, you'll learn all about iterators and iterables, which you have already worked with before when writing for
# loops! You'll learn about some very useful functions that will allow you to effectively work with iterators and
# finish the chapter with a use case that is pertinent to the world of Data Science - dealing with large amounts of
# data - in this case, data from Twitter that you will load in chunks using iterators!

# List Comprehensions and Generators

# In this chapter, you'll build on your knowledge of iterators and be introduced to list comprehensions, which allow
# you to create complicated lists and lists of lists in one line of code! List comprehensions can dramatically
# simplify your code and make it more efficient, and will become a vital part of your Python Data Science toolbox.
# You'll then learn about generators, which are extremely helpful when working with large sequences of data that you
# may not want to store in memory but instead generate on the fly.

# Bring it all Together!

# This chapter will allow you to apply your newly acquired skills towards wrangling and extracting meaningful
# information from a real-world dataset - the World Bank's World Development Indicators dataset! You'll have the
# chance to write your own functions and list comprehensions as you work with iterators and generators and solidify
# your Python Data Science chops. Enjoy!
