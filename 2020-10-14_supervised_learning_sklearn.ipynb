    "Machine learning is the field that teaches machines and computers to learn from existing data to make predictions on new data: Will a tumor be benign or malignant? Which of your customers will take their business elsewhere? Is a particular email spam? In this course, you'll learn how to use Python to perform supervised learning, an essential component of machine learning. You'll learn how to build predictive models, tune their parameters, and determine how well they will perform with unseen dataâ€”all while using real world datasets. You'll be using scikit-learn, one of the most popular and user-friendly machine learning libraries for Python."

    "- The art and science of giving computers the ability to learn to make decisions from data without being explicitly programmed.\n",
    "- Examples:\n",
    "  - Your computer can learn to predict whether an email is spam or not spam, given its content and sender.\n",
    "  - Your computer can learn to cluster, say, Wikipedia entries, into different categories based on the words they contain.\n",
    "    - It could then assign any new Wikipedia article to one of the existing clusters.\n",
    "- Note that, in the first example, we are trying to predict a particular class label, the is, spam or not spam.\n",
    "- In the second example, there is not such label.\n",
    "- When there are labels present, we call it supervised learning.\n",

    "**Unsupervised learning**\n",
    "- In essence, is the machine learning task of uncovering hidden patterns and structures from unlabeled data.\n",
    "- Example:\n",
    "  - A business may wish to group its customers into distinct categories (Clustering) based on their purchasing behavior without knowing in advance what these categories might be.\n",
    "    - This is known as clustering, one branch of unsupervised learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Reinforcement learning**\n",
    "- Machines or software agents interact with an environment.\n",
    "  - Reinforcement learning agents are able to automatically figure out how to optimize their behavior given a system of rewards and punishments.\n",
    "- Reinforcement learning draws inspiration from behavioral psychology and has applications in many fields, such as, economics, genetics, as well as game playing.\n",
    "- In 2016, reinforcement learning was used to train Google DeepMind's AlphaGo, which was the first computer program to beat the world champion in Go.\n",

In the following exercises, you'll be working with the MNIST digits recognition dataset, which has 10 classes, the digits 0 through 9!

Recall that scikit-learn's built-in datasets are of type `Bunch`, which are dictionary-like objects. Helpfully for the MNIST dataset, scikit-learn provides an `'images'` key in addition to the `'data'` and `'target'` keys that you have seen with the Iris data. Because it is a 2D array of the images corresponding to each sample, this `'images'` key is useful for visualizing the images, as you'll see in this exercise (for more on plotting 2D arrays, see [Chapter 2 of DataCamp's course on Data Visualization with Python)][2]. On the other hand, the `'data'` key contains the feature array - that is, the images as a flattened array of 64 pixels.\n",

    "- The question of fitting is reduced to: how do we choose $a$ and $b$?\n",
    "- A common method is to define an error function for any given line, and then choose the line that minimizes the error function.\n",
    "  - Such an error function is also called a loss or a cost function.\n",
    "  \n",
    "**The loss function**\n",
    "- What will our loss function be?\n",
    "- We want the line to be as close to the actual data points as possible.\n",
    "  - For this reason, we wish to minimize the vertical distance between the fit, and the data.\n",
    "- For each data point, calculate the vertical distance between it and the line.\n",
    "  - This distance is called a residual.\n",
    "- We could try to minimize the sum of the residuals, but then a large positive residual would cancel out a large negative residual.\n",
    "  - For this reason, **we minimize the sum of the squares of the residuals**.\n",
    "  - This will be the loss function, and using this loss function is commonly called _ordinary least squares (OLS)_.\n",
    "  - ![][loss]\n",
    "  - Note this is the same as minimizing the mean squared error of the predictions on the training set.\n",
    "    - See the statistic curriculum for more detail.\n",

    "**Linear regression in higher dimensions**\n",
    "- When we have two features and one target, a line is in the form $y=a_{1}x_{1}+a_{2}x_{2}+b$, so to fit a linear regression model, is to specify three variables, $a_{1}$, $a_{2}$, and $b$.\n",
    "- In higher dimensions, with more than one or two features, a line is of this form, $y=a_{1}x_{1}+a_{2}x_{2}+a_{3}x_{3}+...+a_{n}x_{n}+b$, so fitting a linear regression model is to specify a coefficient, $a_{i}$, for each features, as well as the variable $b$.\n",

    "\n",
    "**Linear regression on all _Boston Housing_ features**\n",
    "- The default scoring method for linear regression is called $R^2$.\n",

    "- If we allow these coefficients, or parameters, to be super large, we can get _overfitting_.\n",
    "- It isn't easy to see in two dimensions, but when there are many features, this is, if the data sit in a high-dimensional space with large coefficients, it gets easy to predict nearly anything.\n",
    "- For this reason, it's common practice to alter the loss function, so it penalizes for large coefficients.\n",
    "  - This is called _**Regularization**_.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Ridge regression**\n",
    "- The first type of regularized regression that we'll look at, is called _ridge regression_, in which out loss function is the standard _OLS_ loss function, plus the squared value of each coefficient, multiplied by some constant, $\\alpha$\n",
    "  - $\\text{Loss function}=\\text{OLS loss function}+\\alpha*\\sum_{i=1}^n a_{i}^2$\n",
    "  - Thus, when minimizing the loss function to fit to our data, models are penalized for coefficients with a large magnitude: large positive and large negative coefficients.\n",
    "  - Note, $\\alpha$ is a parameter we need to choose in order to fit and predict.\n",
    "  - Essentially, we can select the $\\alpha$ for which our model performs best.\n",
    "  - Picking $\\alpha$ for ridge regression is similar to picking `k` in `KNN`.\n",
    "- This is called _hyperparameter tuning_, and we'll see much more of this in section 3.\n",
    "- This $\\alpha$, which you may also see called $\\lambda$ in the wild, can be thought of as a parameter that controls the model complexity.\n",
    "- Notice when $\\alpha = 0$, we get back $\\text{OLS}$, which can lead to _overfitting_.\n",
    "  - Large coefficients, in this case, are not penalized, and the _overfitting_ problem is not accounted for.\n",
    "- A very high $\\alpha$ means large coefficients are significantly penalized, which can lead to a model that's too simple, and end up _underfitting_ the data.\n",

    "  - This is because it tends to reduce the coefficients of less important features to be exactly zero.\n",
    "  - The features whose coefficients are not shrunk to zero, are 'selected' by the `LASSO` algorithm.\n",
    "- Plotting the coefficients as a function of feature name, yields graph below, and you can see directly, the most important predictor for our target variable, `housing price`, is number of rooms, `'RM'`.\n",
    "- This is not surprising, and is a great sanity check.\n",
    "- This type of feature selection is very important for machine learning in an industry or business setting, because it allows you, as the Data Scientist, to communicate important results to non-technical colleagues.\n",
