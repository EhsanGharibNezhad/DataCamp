    "Machine learning is the field that teaches machines and computers to learn from existing data to make predictions on new data: Will a tumor be benign or malignant? Which of your customers will take their business elsewhere? Is a particular email spam? In this course, you'll learn how to use Python to perform supervised learning, an essential component of machine learning. You'll learn how to build predictive models, tune their parameters, and determine how well they will perform with unseen dataâ€”all while using real world datasets. You'll be using scikit-learn, one of the most popular and user-friendly machine learning libraries for Python."

    "- The art and science of giving computers the ability to learn to make decisions from data without being explicitly programmed.\n",
    "- Examples:\n",
    "  - Your computer can learn to predict whether an email is spam or not spam, given its content and sender.\n",
    "  - Your computer can learn to cluster, say, Wikipedia entries, into different categories based on the words they contain.\n",
    "    - It could then assign any new Wikipedia article to one of the existing clusters.\n",
    "- Note that, in the first example, we are trying to predict a particular class label, the is, spam or not spam.\n",
    "- In the second example, there is not such label.\n",
    "- When there are labels present, we call it supervised learning.\n",
    "- Where there are not labels present, we call it unsupervised learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Unsupervised learning**\n",
    "- In essence, is the machine learning task of uncovering hidden patterns and structures from unlabeled data.\n",
    "- Example:\n",
    "  - A business may wish to group its customers into distinct categories (Clustering) based on their purchasing behavior without knowing in advance what these categories might be.\n",
    "    - This is known as clustering, one branch of unsupervised learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Reinforcement learning**\n",
    "- Machines or software agents interact with an environment.\n",
    "  - Reinforcement learning agents are able to automatically figure out how to optimize their behavior given a system of rewards and punishments.\n",
    "- Reinforcement learning draws inspiration from behavioral psychology and has applications in many fields, such as, economics, genetics, as well as game playing.\n",
    "- In 2016, reinforcement learning was used to train Google DeepMind's AlphaGo, which was the first computer program to beat the world champion in Go.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Supervised learning**\n",
    "- In supervised learning, we have several data points or samples, described using predictor variables or features and a target variable.\n",

    "- For supervised learning, you need labeled data and there are many ways to go get it: you can get historical data, which already has labels that you are interested in; you can perform experiments to get labeled data, such as A/B-testing to see how many clicks you get; or you can also use crowd-sourced labeling data, like reCAPTCHA does for text recognition.\n",

In the following exercises, you'll be working with the MNIST digits recognition dataset, which has 10 classes, the digits 0 through 9! A reduced version of the [MNIST][1] dataset is one of scikit-learn's included datasets, and that is the one we will use in this exercise.\n",

Recall that scikit-learn's built-in datasets are of type `Bunch`, which are dictionary-like objects. Helpfully for the MNIST dataset, scikit-learn provides an `'images'` key in addition to the `'data'` and `'target'` keys that you have seen with the Iris data. Because it is a 2D array of the images corresponding to each sample, this `'images'` key is useful for visualizing the images, as you'll see in this exercise (for more on plotting 2D arrays, see [Chapter 2 of DataCamp's course on Data Visualization with Python)][2]. On the other hand, the `'data'` key contains the feature array - that is, the images as a flattened array of 64 pixels.\n",
