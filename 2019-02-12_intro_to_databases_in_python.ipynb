Then, you use this **Table** object to read your table from the engine and autoload the columns. Using the **Table** object in this manner is a lot like passing arguments to a function. For example, to autoload the columns with the engine, you have to specify the keyword arguments **autoload=True** and **autoload_with=engine** to **Table()**.\n",
